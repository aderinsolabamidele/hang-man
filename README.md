# hang-man
Setup: One player (the "host") selects a word, usually without revealing it to the other player (the "guesser"). The length of the word is typically indicated by underscores (e.g., "_ _ _ _ _") representing each letter.

Guessing: The guesser starts by suggesting a letter that they believe may be in the word. If the letter is in the word, the host reveals all occurrences of that letter in the word (e.g., "c _ t" if the letter "c" is guessed and the word is "cat"). If the letter is not in the word, a part of the hangman is drawn.

Hangman: For each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman is drawn on the gallows (e.g., head, body, arms, legs). The number of incorrect guesses allowed varies, but it typically results in a complete hangman figure after six to eight incorrect guesses.

Winning or Losing: The game continues until the guesser either correctly guesses the word (by filling in all the blanks) or makes too many incorrect guesses, resulting in the hangman being fully drawn. If the guesser correctly guesses the word, they win; otherwise, the host wins.

The game is often played as a pencil-and-paper game, but it can also be played digitally, as demonstrated in the provided Python code. In the digital version, the program prompts the player to input guesses, reveals correct guesses, and displays the hangman figure as the game progresses.

Overall, Hangman is a fun and challenging word game that can be enjoyed by players of all ages. It's a great way to test your vocabulary and deduction skills while having fun with friends or playing solo.
